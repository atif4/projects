"""use the GridSearchCV module in order to test a number of combinations of parameters 
that can optimize the performance of our model.For hyperparameter tuning we have 3 parameters to consider:

Kernel=rbf (radial basis function): kernel functions are used to map the original dataset (linear/nonlinear ) 
into a higher dimensional space with a view to making it a linear dataset.

C parameter: It is a hypermeter in SVM to control error. It acts as a penalty parameter, a small value of C will result
in a larger margin separating the hyperplane. If we donâ€™t want our training points to be misclassified, then we go for a
large value of C, which will result in a smaller margin separating plane, but it can lead to an overfitting problem where 
the model may not generalize well on training data.

Gamma parameter: This will decide the curvature of the decision boundary, higher the gamma, the greater is the curvature of
the decision boundary."""
